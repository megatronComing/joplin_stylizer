stylize a conversation text for displaying in Joplin with difference color for each speaker

Description: The purpose of writing this program is for my own French learning. The program translates text, which can be in any language, into English and adds HTML styling to color the text differently for different speaking roles in Joplin.

Input: Paste the text into the top input box. The text can be in any language, and the program will automatically detect it. However, the format must be in the form of 'Character Name: Dialogue,' and you cannot use a Chinese colon.
Character1: Dialogue1
Dialogue1.1
Dialogue1.2
Character2: Dialogue2
Character3: Dialogue3
Input text

Output: After pasting the text into the input box, click the 'Stylize' button, then click the 'Copy to Clipboard' button to copy the HTML content to the clipboard. Next, go to Joplin and paste it.
